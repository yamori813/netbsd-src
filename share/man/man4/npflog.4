.Sh NAME
.Nm npflog
.Nd packet filter logging interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device npflog"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm 
interface is a pseudo-device which makes visible all packets logged by
the
.Xr npf 7
packet filter.
Logged packets can easily be monitored in real
time by invoking
.Xr tcpdump 8
on the
.Nm
interface, or stored to disk using
.Xr npfd 8 .
.Pp
The npflog0 interface is created automatically at boot if
.Xr npf 7
is enabled;
further instances can be created using
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
Each packet retrieved on this interface has a header associated
that presently matches the format used by
.Xr pf 4 .
However, this is intentionally not exposed to userland, and is also
possibly subject to change in future.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Monitor all packets logged on the default interface:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# tcpdump -n -e -tttt -i npflog0
.Ed

.Xr inet6 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr npf 7 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr npfd 8 ,
.Xr tcpdump 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .
