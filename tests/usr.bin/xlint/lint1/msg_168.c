/*
 * In its expression tree, lint represents pointer addition as 'ptr + off',
 * where 'off' is the offset in bytes, regardless of the pointer type.
 *
 * In the below code, the member 'offset_8' has type 'short', and the
 * expression 's->offset_8' is represented as '&s + 8', or more verbose:
 *
 *	'+' type 'pointer to short'
 *		'&' type 'pointer to struct s'
 *			'name' 's' with auto 'array[1] of struct s', lvalue
 *		'constant' type 'long', value 8
 *
 * The constant 8 differs from the usual model of pointer arithmetics.  Since
 * the type of the '&' expression is 'pointer to struct s', adding a constant
 * would rather be interpreted as adding 'constant * sizeof(struct s)', and
 * to access a member, the pointer to 'struct s' would need to be converted
 * to 'pointer of byte' first, then adding the offset 8, then converting the
 * pointer to the target type 'pointer to short'.
 *
 * Lint uses the simpler representation, saving a few conversions on the way.
 * Without this pre-multiplied representation, the below code would generate
 * warnings about out-of-bounds array access, starting with offset_1.
