 * Before tree.c 1.198 from 2021-01-30, the nested comma operators were
 * wrongly reported as having no side effect.
 *
 * The bug was that has_side_effect did not properly examine the sub-nodes.
 * The ',' operator itself has m_has_side_effect == false since it depends
 * on its operands whether the ',' actually has side effects.  For nested ','
 * operators, the function did not evaluate the operands deeply but only did
 * a quick shallow test on the m_has_side_effect property.  Since that is
 * false, lint thought that the whole expression would have no side effect.
