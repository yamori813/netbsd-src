 * On 32-bit platforms, it is possible to add a 64-bit integer to a 32-bit
 * pointer.  The 64-bit integer is then converted to the ptrdiff_t of the
 * target platform, which results in the non-obvious conversion from
 * 'long long' to either 'long' or 'int', depending on the platform's
 * ptrdiff_t.

 * C11 6.5.6p8 does not explicitly define the meaning of a pointer + an
