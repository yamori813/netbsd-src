.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn _lwp_unpark_all
resumes execution of one or more light-weight processes listed in
the array pointed to by
.Fa targets .
.Pp
The target LWPs are assumed to be waiting in the kernel as a result of
calls to
.Fn _lwp_park .
If any of the target LWPs are not currently waiting, those LWPs will return
immediately upon the next call to
.Fn _lwp_park .
.Pp
The
.Fa ntargets
argument specifies the size of the array pointed to by
.Fa targets .
.Pp
If the
.Fa targets
argument is given as
.Dv NULL ,
the maximum size of the array
.Pq expressed as the number of entries
is returned.
.Pp
See
.Xr _lwp_park 2
for a description of the
.Fa hint
argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.\" XXX: almsost, but we need the initial "if" clause...
.\" .Rv -std _lwp_unpark_all
If the maximum size of the
.Fa targets
array is not being queried, the
.Fn _lwp_unpark_all
function returns the value 0 if successful;

is set to indicate the error.
